A Discord bot to automate reporting for Animal Crossing New Horizons.

In-progres project in order to familiarize myself with the discord bot API, node, JS in general, and all things programming.

## Setup

0) Ensure that Node v12.16.3 is installed.
1) After cloning locally, rename `example-config.json` to `config.json` and fill in the token field with the appropriate token from Discord.
2) Run with `node index.js`
